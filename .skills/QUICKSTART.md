## 🔧 Common Issues & Fixes

### Missing displayName

**Error:** Component missing displayName

**Fix:**

```typescript
const MyComponent = () => { ... };

MyComponent.displayName = "MyComponent";  // Add this

export default MyComponent;
```

### Missing JSDoc

**Error:** Missing JSDoc comments

**Fix:**

```typescript
/**
 * Description of what this component does
 * @returns What the component renders
 */
const MyComponent = () => { ... };
```

### Array Index as Key

**Error:** Using array index as key

**Fix:**

```typescript
// ❌ Bad
{items.map((item, index) => (
  <div key={index}>{item}</div>
))}

// ✅ Good
{items.map((item) => (
  <div key={item.id}>{item}</div>
))}
```

### Function Declaration

**Warning:** Should use arrow function

**Fix:**

```typescript
// ❌ Avoid
export default function MyComponent() { ... }

// ✅ Prefer
const MyComponent = () => { ... };
export default MyComponent;
```

## 📋 Workflow

### Before Committing

```bash
# 1. Run review
bash .skills/review-code.sh

# 2. Fix any errors
# (edit files as needed)

# 3. Run again to verify
bash .skills/review-code.sh

# 4. Commit when clean
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
```

### During Development

```bash
# Quick check anytime
bash .skills/review-code.sh
```

### In CI/CD (Future)

## 🎨 Customizing Checks

To modify what gets checked, edit `.skills/review-code.sh`

Example: Add new check

```bash
# Add after existing checks
echo "🔍 Checking your custom rule..."
for file in $FILES; do
  # Your check logic here
done
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Run Often** - Catch issues early
2. **Fix Errors First** - Warnings can wait
3. **Read the Report** - Detailed recommendations included
4. **Keep It Green** - Aim for 0 errors, 0 warnings

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied"

```bash
chmod +x .skills/review-code.sh
```

### "Command not found"

Make sure you're in the project root:

```bash
cd /path/to/nextjs-boilerplate
bash .skills/review-code.sh
```

### Script hangs

Increase timeout or check for infinite loops in your code
